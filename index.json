[{"content":"   While pursuing the interwebs, I stumbled across this video from John Hammond.\n  Since I had professional experience with Evilginx and plan to use it more in the future, I took advantage of the discount and decided to buy the course.\nEven though I have worked with the tool before, I knew I had limited knowledge with using it and could not use Evilginx\u0026rsquo;s capabilities to the fullest. The course was very well done and straight to the point. The training labs provided were extremely helpful in cementing how to use the functions and features provided in Evilginx.\nThe course is broken down into 7 sections: Intro, Setup, Getting Started, Advanced Phishing, Security Hardening, Remote Deployment, Deep Sea Phishing. I will be briefly describing what these sections are and what they cover in a little bit more detail than was is provided from the BREAKDEV Academy site.\n Course Overview #   Intro #  Kuba talks about the history of phishing and how reverse proxy phishing arose and become the main standard for phishing attacks today. This is mainly due the addition of multi-factor authentication so attackers had to account for session tokens as well as credentials when phishing. He then explains how Evilginx works from a high-level perspective.\n Setup #  There is a basic walkthrough of how to setup your environment for Evilginx and what tools to run. Kuba goes through the setup of a Windows environment but it is pretty much the same for Linux. The setup is:\n Install Visual Studio Code Install and setup Chrome with profiles  Adding the necessary extensions for editing cookies and local storage Making the delete history setting accessible for testing purposes   Installing Go + Git + Evilginx  Once this is done, Kuba goes over the training labs that are already setup and ready to use for the students. As of currently, there are 4 labs available. Whenever you first purchase the course, you will receive your account information such as the username and password to use. Once you log into the lab environment for the first time, you will be prompted to add MFA.\n Getting Started #  This is where the fun begins. However there is some extra setup requirements needed, especially if you are on Linux (mostly Ubuntu from what I have seen).\nFirst, you need to build Evilginx first. If on Windows, you run build_run.bat / build.bat or use the make command on Linux. For Windows users, you can keep using build_run.bat. The script will automatically rebuild the binary and run it using the necessary flags for developing phishlets for the course. All of this is already described within the documentation.\nAs for Linux users, once the binary is built you can run Evilginx as so:\nsudo ./build/evilginx -p ./phishlets -t ./redirectors -debug -developer This is essentially the same command that is ran within the build.bat script.\nOnce that is complete, Kuba goes over the first lab provided and covers what the general process is for creating a phishlet. Then using the credentials you have for the lab, you phish yourself, and then successfully impersonate your own account!\n Advanced Phishing #  This section is entirely about how to utilize different features within Evilginx. It covers\n Content replacement and changing the way the page is presented to the user How to force POST parameters like the \u0026ldquo;Remember Me\u0026rdquo; button parameter Looking for JSON cookies and local storage JavaScript injection to add custom JavaScript code to your phishing page Landing page redirectors, essentially having a landing page before the phishing login page is presented Mass lure targeting in which you can import emails and names of targets and produce a unique link for each target. Most useful in combination with redirectors and using custom parameters Proxying the reverse proxy. Or in other words, setting up Evilginx to send all its traffic through a web proxy like Burp Suite for more analysis / debugging Blacklist management and the various blacklist modes that can be used and the reasons for why they would be used   Security Hardening #  Different security measures are covered and shown in the last 2 available labs. These being location validation and secret token validation. Kuba shows what the security measures would look like against a basic phishlet, how to look for the security protections in place, and how bypass them.\n Remote Deployment #  Kuba covers how to properly setup Evilginx remotely for real phishing engagements. This goes over the entire process of creating a remote server / VPS, setting that server up with the proper permissions and access, getting a domain hostname, installing Evilginx and setting it up for remote deployment such as having a blacklist, and how to keep persistence with Tmux\n Deep Sea Phishing #  The final section covers Kuba\u0026rsquo;s process of creating a phishlet on real login pages. These include Okta and Microsoft 365 Personal / Entreprise account logins.\n Tips and Tricks #  Now, for things to look out for when taking the course.\nI highly suggest and recommend that anyone that takes this course thoroughly looks through the comments of the videos. There are only a couple videos that should be looked over for comments since they contain information that could help you and or give more clarity to what is seen in the video. Below are the video titles to pay attention to and why the comments should be looked at.\n Preparing the Enviroment  At the time of the recording, Kuba was using an extension called LocalStorage. That extension got flagged for malware so it is recommended that students use StorageAce. This was later addressed when the Microsoft 365 Personal / Entreprise sections were added.   Catching a Phish  If you are on Linux, you most likely had an issue with importing the CA certificate. There are multiple comments on how to fix this issue and I will show my methods of fixing this issue later on below. There was another comment made on how the cookie was captured without the \u0026ldquo;:always\u0026rdquo; modifier added. This is due to the 3.2.0 version of Evilginx always captures session-cookies even without an expiration date. In the video Kuba was using version 3.0.0.   JavaScript Injection  At the time of the recording, Kuba was using Evilginx 3.0.0. When doing JavaScript injection, the injected code would appear at the bottom of the page source. However, with version 3.2.0 the JavaScript injection is loaded in a separate JS file.   Deploy Evilginx  If you are having issues with DNS (which there always are), then reading the comments will definitely help. It appears to be a issue when using Evilginx on Ubuntu Linux but it might be similar on other distros as well. I will also give tips for how to fix any DNS issues below. Fixing DNS issues for Ubuntu has led me to the point of me considering buying this shirt due to how many times I had to deal with it.        CA Certificate Import #  For Linux users, depending on how you run Evilginx, you will have to check two places for the CA certificate to import directly into Chrome to fix the issue of the \u0026lsquo;connection is not private\u0026rsquo; message when visiting the local phishing page.\nFirst, if you are running Evilginx without sudo, then you can use the certificate found in your home folder under .evilginx/certificates/ca.crt\nIf you are running Evilginx with sudo, then you have to import the certificate found within root\u0026rsquo;s folder. However, you have to change the ownership of the certificate before you import it into Chrome. The commands in order should look something like this:\nsudo cp /root/.evilginx/crt/ca.crt \u0026lt;Directory of your choice\u0026gt;/evilginx.crt sudo chown \u0026lt;Your username\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Directory of your choice\u0026gt;/evilginx.crt Once the ownership is changed, the certificate that was copied from root\u0026rsquo;s folder should be able to be imported and the phishlets for the training labs should be able to load properly.\n Linux DNS Fix #  As for fixing DNS within Linux, one of the comments recommended running these commands if you are running Evilginx on Ubuntu.\nEdit the file: /etc/systemd/resolved.conf - Add \u0026quot;DNSStubListener=no\u0026quot; Then restart service: sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved Another method that I use is to do the following:\nsudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service Remove symlink: rm /etc/resolv.conf Recreate the file: vim resolv.conf Add: \u0026quot;nameserver 1.1.1.1 \u0026lt;new line\u0026gt; nameserver 1.0.0.1\u0026quot; Check DNS with nslookup: nslookup google.com Permanently change it: vim /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf - Within main, input \u0026quot;dns=default\u0026quot; This should fix the issue of Evilginx not being about to establish a nameserver when starting up.\n Conclusion #  Overall, it is a great course. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to enhance their red team capabilities specifically for phishing and or wants to learn more about Evilginx. There were a couple times where the videos do not match up with the current version of Evilginx but that is expected with a video-based course.\nI would like to end this article with a comment made by someone at the start of the Deep Sea Phishing section:\n\u0026ldquo;Give a man a phishlet, he\u0026rsquo;ll phish for a day. Teach a man how to create a phishlet, he\u0026rsquo;ll phish for a lifetime\u0026rdquo;\n","date":"December 3, 2023","permalink":"/posts/evilginx-mastery-review/","section":"Posts","summary":"Quick review of the Evilginx Mastery course and helpful tips to use while taking it.","title":"Evilginx Mastery Review"},{"content":"","date":"December 3, 2023","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":"December 3, 2023","permalink":"/tags/review/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Review"},{"content":"","date":"December 3, 2023","permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"   After becoming 1 of 224 with Certified Bug Bounty Hunter, I wanted to write down my experience and hopefully inspire and or at least give insight to people interested in CBBH.\n Why #  I was looking into various web application penetration testing certifications, and all the ones that I saw did not fit my needs. I was looking for an up-to-date certification that did not expire and that I could trust giving me a challenge. The ones that were on the market were either outdated, required subscriptions, the certification had to be renewed, or the course and certification were unnecessarily expensive.\nThat is when I stumbled upon HackTheBox\u0026rsquo;s Certified Bug Bounty Hunter. Initially, I did not like it. I did not like the subscription model that HackTheBox used for academy, as well as the cube system that is implemented. I did not want to have to pay for a subscription on top of the one I already pay for VIP on the main platform.\nHowever, bmdyy\u0026rsquo;s video review made me reevaluate CBBH.\n  One thing that stuck out to me is when he mentioned that you could use information found within the exam on another web application. This piqued my interest since I did not hear about or see anything regarding this in any other web application based certification.\nAnother thing that me made want to pursue the CBBH was the pricing. After looking into the cube system and calculating out how much it would cost to purchase the certification and training required up-front, the price point was good to my surprise. Add in that fact that the course training from CBBH aids in completing the Penetration Tester path required for Certified Penetration Testing Specialist, I bought everything required for CBBH.\nBelow is the full price breakdown.\nNOTE: This is based on the current prices of cubes as of 10/8/23\nFor those that just want to take the CBBH:\nCBBH: Voucher ($210) + Modules ($141 in cubes) = $351 $360 in total rounding up with cube prices ($100 + $50 in cubes) (If you want to, you can just spend $145 by buying cubes with the amounts of $100 + $20 + $20 + $5)\nFor those that just want to take the CPTS:\nCPTS: $210 + $197 = $407 $410 in total rounding up with cube prices ($100 + $100 in cubes) The standalone prices for the certifications are comparable to other certifications on the market. However, the pricing really shines if you plan on taking both the CBBH and CPTS.\nThere are a few caveats however. Assuming that you finish the first two modules, Introduction to Academy and Learning process, this will add 20 extra cubes with the 50 cubes that each HTB academy account starts with:\nBoth Vouchers: 210 + 210 = $420 Training for CBBH: $150 (In cubes) Training for CPTS with CBBH cubes: 114 - 49 = $65 Total: 420 + 150 + 65 = $635 To explain some of the numbers, the value 49 comes from the 70 cubes that you will have before you purchase the modules for CBBH and the 90 cubes leftover from purchasing the path. Then, once you complete the CBBH path, you will get back 330 cubes. So once everything is done with CBBH, you should have 490 cubes. But the price for both certifications with the quaility instruction provided within the trainings is a great deal.\nAs for the amount of progress you gain within CPTS after completing the CBBH path, you get ~30% (28.96%) completion for CPTS. Module wise, you complete 11/28 modules required for the path.\nOne worry that might be on your mind is access to Pwnbox, the Parrot OS VM that HTB Academy provides you to complete the questions and skill assessments that require tools to complete. Based on some of the wording found on the billing page, it might lead you to believe that the Pwnbox has limited usage if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a subscription. However, the FAQ states \u0026ldquo;Get unlimited Pwnbox access by either subscribing for any plan or buying any amount of cubes in Academy\u0026rsquo;s billing page\u0026rdquo;. Once I bought everything in full, I did not have a restriction on Pwnbox usage.\nI did not have any issues with Pwnbox the during the entire time that I was completing the CBBH path. The only minor inconveniences were when I spent too long on a skills assessment and the time ran out on the Pwnbox. The only time that I used my own personal VM when I was completing a question and it was within HTB\u0026rsquo;s internal network due to the attacks that needed to be performed. Specifically, it was the phishing and session sections within the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) module. Every other time that I needed to complete interactive sections and skill assessments, I used Pwnbox.\nHowever, for those that just want to use their own machine, the VPN access works well. Most of the time the interactive sections are publicly accessible, so no VPN is required. There are very few interactive sections that require a VPN, such as the two sections from the XSS module mentioned earlier.\n Course Material #  I must say, the CBBH path is a true zero to hero course. It starts off with the basics of web applications, HTTP requests, and how to use web proxies. Then it slowly ramps up into XSS, SQLi, command injection, and then SSRF to name a few. The material within the modules is nothing short of extremely through and dense. The HTB Academy team did an excellent job of providing all the knowledge you needed to have a strong base within topic covered. Even the small tips and notes provided within the modules helped give more perspective on what was being taught.\nThere were a few modules that I thought did an excellent job of testing your skills that you learned within the sections on the final skill assessments. Most of these were quite hard, but excellent for the simple fact that it helped reinforce and develop your methodology and made you use almost every technique / method that was taught.\nThose were:\n Broken Authentication Wordpress Session Security SQL Injection Fundamentals  This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that the other modules within the CBBH path are not as strong as the ones I listed above. The HackTheBox Academy team did an excellent job of providing interactive sections that test the knowledge that you just learned. There were times when the interactive sections were harder than the final skill assessment in some modules. The modules that come to mind are Command Injections and File Uploads.\n Exam #  The exam is 7 days, you are given a Letter of Engagement with the in-scope and out-of-scope items, the web applications to assess, and a overview of the exam objectives which are the amount of points needed to pass and to submit a report with your findings using the provided report template.\nMy first attempt did not go as well as I thought. However, I was able to refine parts of my methodology and realize what problems I had with my approach. For certain parts of the exam I had tunnel vision and glossed over things that could have gotten me points but I only focused on doing certain things within the exam. At later stages, I only focused on certain attacks and left other parts of the exam alone knowing that the review would help aid me in what to look for in my second attempt.\nI submitted my report and received my review after 9 days. The review and tips provided were very generous and helped guide me into what I needed to focus on during the next attempt. Since I had 14 days until I needed to take the second retake, I revisited the modules that were listed within the review.\nMy second attempt was more successful. I still found myself having tunnel vision and making assumptions on what the attack vectors would be. After some persistence, I was able to get enough points to pass. I submitted my report early in the morning and got my results back within the same day.\nOne of the things that I wanted to make sure I did a good job at was the report. I used the first attempt to gauge what the HTB Academy team was looking for within the report. With my second attempt review, I was surprised that they thought my report was well done. There were no critiques given even when I thought I would get some.\n\u0026ldquo;We found your report to be very well done. You captured the description and impact of each vulnerability very well. You gave actionable remediation recommendations that do not break the line of independence that we must maintain as bug bounty hunters/pentesters (essential third-party auditors) by recommending specific technologies or attempting to re-write the customer\u0026rsquo;s code in the report.\u0026quot;\nAlthough technical ability is very important within offensive security, report writing is a important corner stone that is often overlooked. With this, I was able to gain new technical abilities within web application penetration testing as well as an idea of what a good report should be.\n Conclusion #  Overall, I believe this would an excellent choice for anyone that wants to learn more and test their skills within web application penetration testing.\nThe coursework took about ~94 hours in total for me. There were some modules that I completed faster than the estimated time and others where I stayed up until 3 A.M. trying to get a command to work. I was able to complete half of the course over a course of two weeks by putting 4 hours in everyday. During that time, I was aiming to complete one module everyday. As stated previously however, there were some modules that took me 2 days due to how dense the material was and how difficult the interactive sections / skill assessments were.\nAdding up all the hours for the modules, you get about ~150 hours total. This goes close with what course creators and HTB staff have said with how they calculated the estimated time. The Bug Bounty Path is estimated to be 18 days if you spend around 8 hours each day completing the course work. It might take longer depending on your level of experience and knowledge.\nThe exam itself is good but overwhelming as well. The biggest thing is that the exam requires you to do is to combine things learned within the modules together that weren\u0026rsquo;t spoken about in tandem. You really have to leave no stone unturned when taking it. Add on top of that the black box approach you have to take with the exam.\nAs for preparing the exam, reviewing and going over the interactive sections and the skill assessments from the modules will be enough. However, if you feel like you need more practice outside of the modules PortSwigger Academy is the best place to help reinforce what you learned.\nSome tips that helped me when pursuing this:\n Track your progress, HTB already does part of it for you but to look back and see when you completed modules definitely helps in seeing the journey from a bigger picture and giving yourself some extra motovation. For each question and skill assessment that you do, COPY DOWN WHAT STEPS YOU TOOK. This includes how you approached the questions / assessments / website, how you found the initial part of answering the question, the steps you took to complete the question, and most importantly what commands you ran. Take your time, this isn\u0026rsquo;t a sprint. There is a lot of information to process then to study for the exam. Make sure you reflect back on what modules and questions were the hardest for you to complete and review what stumped you the most. This is where the last tip comes in handy. Note down anytime certain attacks mention other attacks within it. For example, SSRF leveraging XSS or API attacks using SQLi. Create a cheat sheet for yourself for the exam. Take all of your notes and what was taught within the modules and shrink it to a couple of sentences of what to look for and a command to run whenever you are in that situation as described within that section. It will make your life a lot easier. Or better yet, reference the cheat sheets provided within the modules.  If you find yourself interested in tackling the CBBH yourself, you still haven\u0026rsquo;t registered for an account on HackTheBox Academy, and thought my article did a good job of covering important aspects of what the CBBH is like, here is a shameless plug for my referral link. If you find yourself not aligning with any of the statements said previously, then ignore the link.\n","date":"October 8, 2023","permalink":"/posts/certified-bug-bounty-hunter-review/","section":"Posts","summary":"Review of HackTheBox Academy\u0026rsquo;s Certified Bug Bounty Hunter certification, the reasons why I chose this certification, review of the course material, and how the exam is.","title":"Certified Bug Bounty Hunter Review"},{"content":"   I wanted to write about Discord OSINT techniques since there were a few that I have used that I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen mentioned anywhere online. The only article that brings up most of what I will be writing about is this one from OSINTCurio.us. The article does an excellent job of covering techniques that can be used when gathering OSINT within Discord. Some other resources that I found on the subject are a couple of GitHub pages. The first one is OSINT-Discord-resources and the other one is DiscordOSINT, but it is very limiting. Most of the techniques online are useful but they don\u0026rsquo;t really cover other techniques and methods that could be used to in conjunction with gathering information on a person of interest.\nHowever, it should be noted that Discord is not the best for OSINT. Information within Discord is not very \u0026lsquo;open\u0026rsquo; since it requires user authentication and invite links to public / private servers and or chat rooms. Though OSINT techniques can still be applied to people of interest which I will cover shortly. Also, I will be talking about these methods assuming that you already have a general understanding of OSINT.\n Basics #  Most of what is online covers how to use the search function (found within the top right) within Discord. This is just as powerful as Google dorking. Searching for from: uberzachattack would bring up everything that I have said within the Discord server you are viewing. Adding other terms and keywords such as has: or in: can narrow down where you are looking and what you are looking for.\nChaining everything together would provide something like from: uberzachattack has: link in: server-invites. This would hypothetically search for any instance where I might have shared a Discord server link within the channel #server-invites. Keywords can be used as well without any operators. You can even search for the keyword discord.gg as mentioned in the OSINTCurio.us article.\nHere is an example search of searching for links within general chat, the search being from: uberzachattack has: link in: general-talk   This is a common method brought up online regarding Discord. It all comes back to trying to gather as much information from a person of interest and seeing if they have sent any messages that would be of interest to us, such as private Discord server invites or PII.\nAnother method that I found is basic searches for public Discord servers. One site that comes to mind is Discordbee. This can certainly help, but you can search for servers within Discord with the Explore function or even through a simple Google search.\n 1. Linked Accounts #  This is brought up online a few times, but it is something worth mentioning. A lot of people on Discord are unaware of the fact that they exposed their accounts to other services including personal ones. This is controlled within the user settings within the Connections tab. The accounts that are linked can be hidden from your profile.\nSeeing what linked accounts there are can help with identifying any personal accounts like Facebook or Instagram or even help discover a different username or alias that is used by the person in question.\nThe first example is something more commonly found, there are a couple of linked accounts but the person in question did not realize that they linked their real name to their Discord username and usernames with other services listed.   The second example is of someone that does not realize how much information they are sharing through their connected accounts. You can link 4 usernames and a real name to all the accounts that are shared, with 3 of the connected accounts having the person\u0026rsquo;s real name.     As you can see, you can tie a real name to an alias that the person of interest uses.\n 2. Mutual Servers #  This is something that I have done plenty of times to see what other servers people might be a part of.\nThis will be covered more in depth later on, but the main thing is that this can give you an idea of what the person is interested in based on what servers you and the person of interest are both within. The mutual servers found can things like gaming servers, coding communities, or cybersecurity servers.\nAlso, Discord users are able to set different nicknames for themselves in different servers. This could also reveal different usernames and aliases that the person of interest might use. This would lead us back to Linked Accounts.\nHere is an example of a user having different nicknames / usernames in different servers:    3. Student Hubs #  One of the biggest places to gather OSINT within Discord that is not mentioned online at all. The only stipulation is that you need to have an .edu email at a certain University in order to join Student Hubs. The one I will be covering is the PSU Student Hub.\nThe biggest mistake people make is using their full name when joining a Student Hub. The prompt asks for your name whenever you join, which people put in, unaware that it will appear on their Discord profile through mutual servers.\n   Another important note, Student Hubs do not have any moderation oversights at all. You can report servers within the Student Hub but that is about it. The only moderation that is used is that you have to verify your .edu email when you try to join a Student Hub. After that, you are free to link a Discord server that you run or moderate to the student hub and join whatever Discord servers are listed within the hub. I am still able to access the student hub for PSU even though I have graduated over a year ago.\n   You could try to look for public University Discord servers through Google but Student Hubs give you direct access. However, there are a couple instances where there will be unrelated Discord servers that are within the PSU Student Hub that do not have any affiliation to PSU at all. The only way that they would be added to the Student Hub is if a server admin or moderator of the server added it themselves, in which you would know that it was a student / faculty member (Mainly students since Discord is for zoomers).\n 4. Fingerprinting Community Types #  This is the most intensive process when it comes to the techniques and methods that I have discovered for Discord OSINT and the main technique that I wanted to talk about.\nI will show examples of fingerprinting the Cybersecurity Discord communities and how to fingerprint a University\u0026rsquo;s Discord communities through Student Hubs. I\u0026rsquo;ll start with cybersecurity since it is more applicable and accessible (and one that I am involved in the most).\nIf we are in a situation where we are gathering information on a person of interest through Discord, the most important element is to try and identify what communities they are involved in. In this hypothetical case, the person of interest is heavily involved within the cybersecurity community. With that in mind, we should try and find what the biggest Discord servers are that are related to cybersecurity. Some that comes to mind are DEFCON, HackTheBox, TryHackMe, TCM Security, etc. Other servers that could be on the list would be online personalities like John Hammond, tool developers (Hashcat or Porchetta Industries), or even cybersecurity companies (Like TCM or even Red Siege).\nNow that we have a small collection of servers, we can try to see how much involvement they have within each server and the Discord server community at large.\nBased on the amount of servers the person is within, we can gauge their level of involvement. Here are some examples of what the person\u0026rsquo;s involvement might be. We could also make assumptions about what type of person they are based on the Discord server\u0026rsquo;s ethos, personalities, and culture.\nThe methodology here is simple, join as many servers as possible that pertain to the community.\nInitially, our server list that we are a part of would look like this:   Servers:\n DEFCON TCM Security, HackTheBox, and TryHackMe have not been joined yet  Once we join some servers that are within the cybersecurity community, the visibility of what servers the person of interest is in would be shown:   Servers that we have joined:\n DEFCON, TCM Security, HackTheBox, TryHackMe, Zero-point Security, Blue Team Labs Online, Security Blue Team, Hashcat, Red Siege, Black Lantern Security, PicoCTF, Porchetta Industries  To further illustrate what I am demonstrating, below are some sample profiles that will be used as case studies.\n Case Study #1 #  List of mutual servers:   Server Visibility Representation:   For case study #1, there is a heavy emphasis on training companies. TCM Security, HackTheBox, and TryHackMe provide platforms for training and practicing your cybersecurity skills.\n Case Study #2 #  List of mutual servers:   Server Visibility Representation:   For case study #2, we can infer that they have an interest within offensive security and studying for it. This is due to TCM Security, HackTheBox, and Zero-point security providing training and having certifications like the PNPT, CPTS, and CRTO respectfully.\n Case Study #3 #  List of mutual servers:     Server Visibility Representation:   For case study #3, we can infer the same information as case study #2. However, they are also a part of Porchetta Industries. They host a lot of popular, open source tools such CrackMapExec. Based on this, case study #3 might be interested in tool development.\n Case Study #4 #  List of mutual servers:   Server Visibility Representation:   For case study #4, they are the most unique compared to the other case studies. Based on what servers they are in, there is a heavy emphasis on defensive security. It is safe to say that this case study works as a SOC analyst and or is interested in learning about defensive security.\nThen for Student Hubs, the work of trying of finding what servers are a part of the target community is removed and is easily given to us.   Same methodology as before, join as many or specific (Computer Science, Cybersecurity, etc.) servers to gain more visibility.   Then using the methods and techniques talked about earlier, we can try to see if they use different aliases or nicknames, looked at linked accounts, and most importantly search through their chat history to look for interesting information.\nThe mutual servers found on someone\u0026rsquo;s profile can even give insights into what type of demographic and personality they might have as stated earlier.\n 5. Location Based Servers #  Another interesting element of mutual servers are joining servers that can be tied to certain locations.\nServers that come to mind are BSides Discord servers. If you have enough location based servers, such as BSides or DEFCON even (although it is a global level conference), you would be able to infer the location that the person of interest lives in.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s say you have server visibility on BSides Harrisburg, BSides Philly, and BSides Charm (Baltimore) and the person of interest is within those Discord servers, you could infer that they live within the area of the Southeast PA, Northern Maryland and Delaware, and Southern New Jersey.\nNOTE: BSides Harrisburg is the only conference in this example with a Discord server, however this is a demonstration.   This should be analyzed carefully, if the event is popular enough then people would be willing to travel to them. I have gone to a couple of BSides events within New York and met a speaker that was from Chicago. If the Discord server is in a niche location, then there is a higher chance that the person of interest is within the same location area.\n Conclusion #  To summarize these techniques and methods with a high level overview, they are:\n Identify what communities the person of interest would be a part of Join as many servers that are within that community ecosystem to gain as much visibility as you can Once you have the person of interest\u0026rsquo;s profile, looked for linked accounts and different nicknames within different servers Search for the person of interest\u0026rsquo;s chat history within each server they are in to try and find interesting information about them Also join location based Discord servers that are within the community to try to find where the person of interest might live  One thing to keep in mind is that a Discord only allows you tojoin up to 100 servers, 200 if you subscribe to Nitro. The best way to utilize these methods would be to develop a sock puppet account and have that tied to certain communities. There are many great resources and articles like this one that cover how to make a sock puppet account if you are interested in going that route.\nThe only worry when utilizing these methods is that you will have to do manual verification as mentioned in the OSINTCurio.us article. Also, few servers might require active participation and prune any members that are not active within the server. The good news is that logging into Discord every 7 days helps avoid this.\nIf you are interested in trying to protect yourself from these techniques and methods, here are a couple of tips:\n Review your connections within user settings The same old adage applies here in Discord, once it\u0026rsquo;s on the internet it\u0026rsquo;s there forever Keep your username the same for all servers To limit how many people join a private server of yours from trying to see if you posted any invite links, create invite links that expire or have limited uses  Now, use this information at your own discretion.\nFor those curious, Toolscord helped me with getting the logos for the Discord servers shown.\n","date":"August 18, 2023","permalink":"/posts/quick-note-on-discord-osint/","section":"Posts","summary":"I will be going over Discord OSINT techniques and methodologies that I have not seen online.","title":"Quick Note on Discord OSINT"},{"content":"","date":"August 18, 2023","permalink":"/tags/research/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Research"},{"content":"   I will be going over why I decided to create my own website and how you can do the same using Hugo and the Blowfish theme.\n Why #  I got my inspiration to create this site from Luke Smith, specifically from this video he made about Hugo. Realizing how easy it was to make a website and his thoughts on internet independence (becoming a internet landlord) really resonated with me.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, sites like Medium and Hashnode are great for posting articles. However, I wanted to have the freedom with having a personal site hosted somewhere. Medium and Hashnode are only meant for posting articles, while with a personal site you can post articles and do whatever else you would like.\nPlus, creating your articles in markdown and not having to worry about HTML and CSS is great. This made my decision easier since I already use Obsidian for my notes. I can simply copy-paste articles that I write within Obsidian over to Hugo.\nHere is a quick list of all the reasons why I choose to create my own site.\n To have internet independence as stated previously. In other words, relying less on platforms or services like social media and creating you own. A place to share my projects, thoughts, and ideas and to help other people at the same time. To pay it forward. Convenience of using markdown for articles. Having one place that I could put stuff within instead of having separate things on multiple sites. Resume booster and personal branding. Running a website costs less than $15 on average. Most importantly, creative output. I feel like this is something that is not talked about as much as it needs to be. Having an outlet to where you can be creative is important since it is direct expression of who you are. Writing might not be viewed as the most creative medium but it still counts. Finally, a quote that I enjoy. \u0026ldquo;Find three hobbies you love: One to make you money, one to keep you in shape, and one to be creative.\u0026rdquo; Why not have 2 of the hobbies be connected in some way?   Setup and Prerequisites #  Here are some of the things needed to create your first site.\n Domain name Hosting service Linux virtual machine to develop the site GitHub account   Domain Name and Hosting #  A good friend of mine recommended that I check out Cloudflare Pages. They offer free static site hosting, domain name registration, and built utilities like website traffic analytics.\nSearch for the domain name that you would like your site to have and pick an extension that you would like. Depending on the popularity of your domain name, the average price will be around $12. There are other domain registrars where you can buy your domain name for less, but it usually hovers around ~$10.\nThe quickest way to get a domain name if you have a Gmail account is to head to Google Domains. If you are against giving Google owning more of your data, you can choose Epik or Domain.com. There are many registrars out there to choose from.\nAs for hosting, you can go with Digital Ocean, Amazon, Azure, or Vultr.\nThe important thing with finding a hosting service is to find one that is able to host static sites and have automatic TLS / SSL encryption. Digital Ocean is another good choice since the Starter plan is free and hosts 3 static sites, it\u0026rsquo;s only $3 a month for every additional site.\nIf you are feeling adventurous, you can go down the route of using a VPS and creating it with Nginx and certbot, LandChad.net is a good place to start for that.\n Development area #  I just use a Ubuntu virtual machine to run Hugo and create articles.\nJust ensure that Go and Hugo are updated and ready to be used.\n GitHub Account #  The most important component within this equation. This is where the site will be stored and how the hosting service will find the code for your website.\n Building the Site #  Now that everything is prepared, we can start using Hugo and Blowfish.\nFirst, create a new site with Hugo with hugo new site \u0026lt;site name\u0026gt;. This will create a new directory where you ran the command.\nThen, download the theme using git.\ncd mywebsite git init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Finally, read over the Blowfish documentation so that you have a proper understanding of how to utilize the theme.\nNow, assuming that you didn\u0026rsquo;t read the documentation, here are the important things of note.\n Understanding the page structure with Hugo, such as Branch vs Leaf pages Understanding the directory structure of Hugo  content/ is where the articles will be stored in markdown, public/ is where the HTML will be generated once you are done creating your site   The notable articles are Configuration, Shortcodes, Series, Content Examples  Edit: Front Matter is also very important, particularly for customizing articles separately   Create the homepage by running hugo new _index.md Setup the configuration files as described within the documentation  Setup config.toml, then configure preferences you would like within languages.en.toml, menus.en.toml, and params.toml  languages.en.toml dictates how your homepage will look and controls some overarching settings that affect the entire site menus.en.toml controls the menu at the header and footer of the page params.toml is where most of the magic happens. This has most of the settings for the website and has settings for how your articles / posts will look like     Whenever creating an article / post, you can directly overwrite a setting from the params file if you would like to change the way the article behaves Have two terminal windows open, one running hugo server -D -noHTTPCache and the other being used to create and modify markdown pages  The hugo server command will build draft pages (-D) and prevent HTTP caching (-noHTTPCache) hugo server will create your site locally at localhost:1331, this will allow you to see any changes you make live    The rest should be fairly simple. Create markdown files with the hugo new command and experiment with the site. Ensure that pages aren\u0026rsquo;t in \u0026ldquo;draft\u0026rdquo; mode when you are creating some parts of your website and or ready to build the site.\n Making the Site Live #  Now that you created a good base for your website, it\u0026rsquo;s time to upload it to GitHub and link it to your hosting service.\nSimply run hugo within your site directory to convert the markdown files into HTML. This will be stored within the public/ directory.\nOnce the files are ready, create and setup a new repository on GitHub for your site. Then commit and push the files to the repository.\nI used GitKraken to make things easy. I created a new project directory with the public folder and created a new remote repository using the link generated from the newly created GitHub repository (The link should look like https://github.com/\u0026lt;Your Name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;site repository\u0026gt;.git). Then you should see the files on the left side that can be committed. Once that is done, simply use the push button at the top. Confirm that all the files are in your site repository.\nThen, go over to the hosting service of your choice to grab the repository files. With Cloudflare Pages, I simply created a new website in the dashboard with my domain name. I then went to the Workers and Pages menu on the left and made a new page.\nCloudflare will walk you through connecting your account and linking your repository. The next few steps are very simple once you link your repository.\nOnce the site is deployed in Cloudflares network, click on your Cloudflare Page to go into the settings and head over to Custom domains. Simply press Set up a custom domain and type in the domain name that you bought for your site.\n Updating the Site #  Now that the hard part is over, all that needs to be done to have a reliable way of updating your site repository.\nAs stated previously, using GitKraken makes it very easy. Once there are more articles made that are ready to be put onto the site, simply run hugo and commit and push the changes within GitKraken.\nAs for Cloudflare, it will take a while for it to update the page. The site can be redeployed manually within the Page overview section to have it update faster.\n I hope this article helped you with knowing that making your own site isn\u0026rsquo;t that hard and doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost that much. Now go out and create your own site and have fun while doing it!\n","date":"July 13, 2023","permalink":"/posts/how-to-create-your-own-website/","section":"Posts","summary":"I will be going over why I decided to create my own website and how you can do the same using Hugo and the Blowfish theme.","title":"How to Create Your Own Website"},{"content":"","date":"July 13, 2023","permalink":"/tags/projects/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Projects"},{"content":"Here to share and document my journey\n","date":"July 6, 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Homepage","summary":"Here to share and document my journey","title":"Homepage"},{"content":"Hello, my name is Zach.
